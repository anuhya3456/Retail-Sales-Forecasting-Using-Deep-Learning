# 🛒 Retail Sales Forecasting Using Deep Learning

This project uses **TensorFlow** to build a deep learning model for **retail sales forecasting**. The system processes historical transaction data and predicts sales, enabling better inventory planning and business decisions.

---

## 📌 Project Summary

- Achieved **91% accuracy** using deep learning on retail sales data.
- Processed over **1M transactions** using **GCP BigQuery**.
- Built real-time sales dashboards in **Google Data Studio**.
- Integrated **feature engineering**, **batch normalization**, and **hyperparameter tuning**.
